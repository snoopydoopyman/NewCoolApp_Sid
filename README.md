# New Cool App - Git Pull Request Exercise

Your task is as follows:

1. Elect a **team leader**.
2. The **team leader** must fork this repo to create a copy under your user.
3. Invite the rest of your team to contribute to your repository. You can do this under **Settings -> Manage access**. 
4. Each team member (including the leader) must clone the repo to their machine and do the following:
    - Create a feature branch off the `development` branch with the naming format `feature/<your_name>`.
    - Add your name and favourite food to the lists in `app.py`, then commit your changes.
    - Push your new branch up to your repo.
    - Create a pull request where the base branch is set to `development`, and the compare branch is set to `feature/<your_name>`.
    - Resolve any merge requests.
5. Once everyone's feature branch is merged into `development`, merge from `development` into `main` to 'release' the new version.

First team to merge to main wins!

**Note:** Before anyone gets any *smart ideas*, the doing the following is **not allowed**:

- Committing the team's name and food directly to `main`.
- Only creating one merge request that contains every member's name and food.
- Merging a feature branch directly into `main`.

Each member **must** create a separate pull request and merge into `development`! Anything else is CHEATING!
